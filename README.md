# Portfolio

## Description
This project is a portfolio page that showcases my skills as a web developer. It contains sections about me, my work, my resume and how to contact me. It also displays some of the web applications that I have created. The portfolio page is responsive, scalable, interactive, and user-friendly.

## Usage
The website consists of four sections: About me, Work, Resume and Contact. 
The About me section contains a brief introduction of myself. 
The Work section contains a grid of web applications that I have worked on, with titles and images. 
The Resume section contains my CV and recent employment history.
The Contact section contains basic contact details such as my email address and social media.

The user can navigate to different sections by clicking on the links in the navigation menu or by scrolling the web page. The user can also click on the images of the web applications to go to the live demos or the source codes.

The website is responsive and adapts to different screen sizes and devices. The layout and design of the website change according to the width of the viewport. For example, on smaller screens, the grid of web applications becomes a single column instead of two.

Here are some GIF's of the website from three different viewports (<600px, <768px, <1020px):
