        Hi, my name is Chersilnt Ntervisi, I am 26 years old IT professional.
        I am a senior network administrator for a private school in London,
        where I am responsible for strategic planning, installing,
        configuring, and maintaining the school's network infrastructure. I
        have three years of experience in network administration, and I have
        successfully implemented and managed various network projects, such as
        network security, wireless access, VPN, VoIP, cloud computing and 1 on
        1 devices. I have a strong knowledge of network protocols and
        optimization of network performance and security. I love my job
        because it allows me to use my technical background and IT skills to
        solve problems and improve the network efficiency and reliability. I
        also enjoy working with other network professionals and teachers, and
        providing them with support and guidance. When I am not working, I
        enjoy learning web development, which is another passion of mine. I am
        interested in creating and designing websites that are responsive,
        interactive, and user-friendly. I am only just starting my front end
        development journey and I am familiar with HTML, CSS. I am excited to
        learn more about web development technologies and frameworks, such as
        React, Angular, or Bootstrap. I also care about web accessibility,
        performance, and security, and I follow the best practices and
        standards of web development. I am looking for opportunities to
        advance my knowledge in web development and to collaborate with others
        on challenging and meaningful projects. If you want to get in touch
        with me, feel free to drop me an email. You can find my details in the
        <a href="#contact">contact</a> section. You can also check out some of
        my work on GitHub. I look forward to hearing from you and learn more
        about you and your passions.

          <h2>Personal Profile</h2>
          <p>Hi, I'm Chersilnt. I'm an IT professional in the education sector. I have experience in managing and
            troubleshooting various IT systems, networks, servers, software, and hardware. In my free time, I enjoy
            learning coding with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.</p>
          <p>I have a Master's degree in Applied Computing and Information Technology with an overall grade of
            distinction. Being the Senior Network Administrator at a private school has enabled me to become a confident
            and strong communicator with the ability to manage multiple tasks efficiently and responsibly, as well as
            work with the team to achieve a certain objective on time with excellence.</p>
          <p>I believe that such experience, together with the analytical, evaluative, and troubleshooting skills honed
            during my undergraduate and postgraduate degrees, have equipped me with the necessary skills to troubleshoot
            and resolve critical network issues.</p>
